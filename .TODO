Hacka'mole

General
- Cartoony design
- Light-hearted
- Light color scheme
- Find a font
- Only points for hitting Gary
    - Minus points for hitting Gage
    - Gage in some kind of princess hat?

REACT
- "Heckles" the Squirrel mascot?
- When win, drop the sunglasses down on the squirrel.
- Squirrel heckles while player plays
    - Could show up randomly on the site
    - Could integrate chuck norris api or some other fun api into the heckles
- Gary and Gage heads


Game Logic
- 3x3 mole board
- after x points shortens time items are available to be hit
- Timer determines end of Game
- Scoring
    - Gain points for hitting gary
    - Lose points for hitting Gage
    - Hit gage too many times, or game ends, you get the "you have been logged out of Hacka'Mole", poking fun of Bootcampspot
- Gary power mode where all the moles are just gary's for x time
- Mega Gage - If you don't hit him before he goes away, you lose the game.
- Full board or have some empty holes as well
- Need to get a "Damnit Drew" or something like that from Gary 

API's
 - Either find one to use or crowdsource from the class our own heckles
    - If crowd source - Direct Message to whole class instead of a channel in slack. Maybe on Monday.

TECH

Turning pointer into hammer

Backend/Routes/Server Part of the Task
- High Scores Scoreboard
- Heckles db of the heckles
